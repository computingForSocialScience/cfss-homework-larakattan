1. What: I propose to study the economic and demographic changes in Chicago over the last fifteen years (or as many years as 
it's possible to get economic Census data). Using data on population, payroll, education outcomes (proxied by test scores),
employment and other economic indicators, overlayed on a map, I will look for patterns that may have public policy relevance. 

2. Why: Chicago has been losing population for more than a decade. This has already resulted in 50 public schools
being closed and lots of land being empty, especially on the south and west sides, which were stronger hit during the
recession. This study will have public policy implications, helping policy makers zero in on which parts of the city
require which services. This will enable better-targeted policy initiatives and more efficient use of public funds. 

3. How: The economic and population data will come from the ACS and other Census Bureau survey instruments, including
the Economic Census, administered every five years (most recently in 2012). I will also collect data from Chicago 
datasets on employment, payroll, and other economic indicators. I hope to do some analysis of network effects using
NetworkX and to possibly run some regressions on education outcomes (proxied by test scores) with covariates on 
economic health and population changes. For this I aim to use scikit and other Python libraries.
